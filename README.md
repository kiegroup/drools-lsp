Overview
===
This is an experimental implementation of [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) based project intended to provide support for a [DRL](https://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/latest/drools-docs/html_single/#drl-rules-con_drl-rules) text editor.

It is composed of 2 parts: the **server** containing the actual LSP implementation and the **client** which is a VSCode extension consuming the services provided by the server.

The server is a plain Java/Maven project. Executing a `mvn clean package` in its folder will generate a jar file that will be automatically linked and consumed by the client when executed as a VSCode extension.

Server Architecture
===

The server part is composed of three modules:
1. **drools-parser** - responsible for actual drl-syntax parsing, eventually invoking a JAVA-LSP engine to read the `RHS` content (that is plain Java code); it depends on `org.drools:drools-drl-ast`
2. **drools-completion** - used to provide completion suggestion using the C3 engine; it depends on `com.vmware.antlr4-c3:antlr4-c3` and on `drools-parser`
3. **drools-lsp-server** - the "gateway" between the client and the parsing/completion logic; by itself it should not implement any business logic, but should be concerned only with communication; it depends directly on `drools-completion`

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Usage
===

**Precompiled-server - no debug**
1. package server side code with `mvn clean package`
2. goto `client` directory
3. issue `npm install`
4. issue `code .` to start VSCode in that directory
5. inside VSCode, select `Run and Debug` (Ctrl+Shift+D) and then start `Run Extension`
6. a new `Extension Development Host` window will appear, with `drl` extension enabled
7. to "debug" server-side event, add `server.getClient().showMessage(new MessageParams(MessageType.Info, {text}));` in server-side code

**Connected remote server - debug**
1. package server side code with `mvn clean package`
2. start server with `DroolsLspTCPLauncher` from IDE on debug mode; this will start the LSP-server listening on port `9925`
3. goto `client` directory
4. issue `npm install`
5. issue `code .` to start VSCode in that directory
6. inside VSCode, select `Run and Debug` (Ctrl+Shift+D) and then start `Debug Extension`
7. the extensions will establish a connection to the server running at port `9925`
8. a new `Extension Development Host` window will appear, with `drl` extension enabled
9. to "debug" server-side event, add breakpoints in server-side code

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) Usage
===
Neovim has [built-in](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html) LSP support, however client configuration is a manual process. It can be made a lot easier, though, if you leverage some of the many plugins available to do the hard parts for you, as you will see in the example below. _Please note:_
- Neovim will connect to the drools-lsp-server directly, bypassing the VSCode client extension.
- You are required to have a java runtime environment installed on your system, either with the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable set, or with the `java` command locatable in your `PATH`.
- The example below only shows the relevant portions of one's nvim `init.lua` file, assuming user familiarity with Neovim configuration (including working with plugins and [keymappings](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig#Suggested-configuration), among other things).

**Example Configuration**
1. Use [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) (plugin installer) to install [nvim-lspconfig](http://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) (standard Neovim LSP configurations), [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) (an _excellent_ LSP/DAP/Linter/Formatter package manager), and [mason-lspconfig.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim) (the `mason.nvim` to `nvim-lspconfig` bridge):
```lua
  use 'wbthomason/packer.nvim'
  use {
    'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',
    requires = {
      'williamboman/mason.nvim',
      'williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim',
    },
  }
```
2. Get `mason` up-and-running:
```lua
require('mason').setup {}
require('mason-lspconfig').setup {}
```
3. Initialize the `drools-lsp` server (configuration options [here](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#drools_lsp)):
```lua
require('lspconfig').drools_lsp.setup {
  -- configuration options can be put here
  -- when using mason, nothing is required!
}
```
4. Add automatic filetype detection of DRL files (necessary to trigger the language server startup):
```lua
vim.cmd[[ autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.drl set filetype=drools ]]
```
5. Startup `nvim` anew, have `packer` install the plugins, have `mason` [install the language server](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim/blob/main/PACKAGES.md#drools-lsp), and start editing DRL!
```vim
:PackerSync
:MasonInstall drools-lsp
:edit your.drl
```
